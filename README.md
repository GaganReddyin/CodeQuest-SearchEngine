- Web scraping: The search engine scrapes question data from websites such as LeetCode, Codeforces, and CodeChef using Beautiful Soup and Selenium.
- TF-IDF algorithm: It implements the TF-IDF algorithm to find potential documents (questions) related to the user's query.
- Web application: The search engine is integrated into a web application built with Node.js and React, allowing users to search for questions and view the results.

## Installation
